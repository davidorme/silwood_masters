<h1>
    Teaching staff
</h1>

<p>
    This table shows all of the staff that have ever been associated with Masters
    teaching, project supervision or marking. You can edit staff members to update
    email addresses - people often carry on working with us after changing institution -
    and any other details.
</p>
<p>
    Please <strong>search this table before adding new staff</strong> so we do not
    duplicate the same person with different details!
</p>
<p>
    There are three flags associated with teaching staff:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Can Supervise</strong>: Only staff with this flag set are allowed to
        create, advertise and then supervise research projects.

    </li>
    <li><strong>Is Internal</strong>: Only staff with this flag set can sole
        supervise research projects. External supervisors must have an internal
        supervisor supporting the project.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Is Active</strong>: You <strong>cannot delete</strong> members of
        staff - they will likely be associated with previous teaching and marking in the
        database - but you can mark them as inactive, which will hide them from view for
        most users. <strong> Projects associated with inactive staff will not be publicly
            visible</strong> so this option can also be used to temporarily hide project adverts if
        staff are unavailable.</p>
    </li>

</ul>
