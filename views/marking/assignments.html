<h1>Marking assignments</h1>

<p>The table below shows all the assignments created on the system along with their current 
	status. Authorised users can use the view links to look at and edit reports: this ability 
	is needed to fix problems or moderate reports. Each assignment has one of the following 
	status indicators.
	</p>

<TABLE class='table'>
	<TR>
		<TD>
			{{=status_dict['Created']}}
		</TD>
		<TD>
			<strong>Created</strong>. When new assignments are <A href={{=URL('new_assignment')}}>
			created</A> or <A href={{=URL('load_assignments')}}>uploaded</A>, they are given this 
			status. This gives coordinators a chance to check assignments before they are sent to
			markers and supervisors.
		</TD>
	</TR>
	<TR>
		<TD>
			{{=status_dict['Not started']}}
		</TD>
		<TD>
			<strong>Not started</strong>. These assignments have been distributed to their marker
			but no marking data has yet been entered. 
		</TD>
	</TR>
	<TR>
		<TD>
			{{=status_dict['Started']}}
		</TD>
		<TD>
			<strong>Started</strong>. The marker has entered some marking data and saved their
			progress but the report has not yet been submitted.
		</TD>
	</TR>
	<TR>
		<TD>
			{{=status_dict['Submitted']}}
		</TD>
		<TD>
			<strong>Submitted</strong>. The marker has completed their report and submitted it.
		</TD>
	</TR>
	<TR>
		<TD>
			{{=status_dict['Released']}}
		</TD>
		<TD>
			<strong>Released</strong>. These reports have been released to students.
		</TD>
	</TR>
</TABLE>

<h2>Actions</h2>

	There are five actions that can be applied to sets of records. The search box above the

		<TD>
			Send to Markers

		<TD>
			This action will automatically distribute the marking links to markers. 
		</TD>

			Note that only completed reports will be included.
		</TD>
	</TR>
	<TR>

		</TD>

	<TR>
		<TD>

		</TD>

			Release to Students
		</TD>

			This action emails the students with links to their reports. They will receive an email 
			containing a set of links that will allow them to download a PDF of the report, excluding 
			any confidential report fields. The system will only release submitted and previously 
			released reports, so you can resend links but not accidentally release partial reports.
		</TD>
	</TR>
</TABLE>



<h5>Current and old reports</h5>

<p>By default, this page only shows records from the most current academic year, but you can 
	click on <a href={{=URL('assignments2', vars=dict(request.vars, **{'all': ''}))}}>this link</a> 
	show all records. There are {{=old_count}} reports from previous years, so these may take a 
	while to load.
