<H2>Project Marking</H2>

<p>Welcome to the project marking pages for Masters courses at the 
	Silwood Park campus of Imperial College London and the Natural History 
	Museum.
</p>

<p>These pages handle the distribution of project marking assignments, 
	providing online forms for marker and supervisors to complete, and making
	marking feedback available to students at the end of project assessment.

      <BR><H4>Dear Markers and Supervisors</H4>
      <p>A huge thanks for the effort you've already put in to supervising students and are about 
		  to put in marking and grading their reports. These projects are a major part of the 
		  assessment of Masters students and an an equally major part of their learning experience 
		  during the course. The time you spend supporting this is hugely appreciated by both course
		  coordinators and students (although it may not look like that during an actual viva!).</p>

      <p>We appreciate that you might prefer to hand write your report. However, this system 
		  allows us to:</p>
      <ol>
      <li>keep all project marking data together in single location;</li> 
      <li>easily keep track of marking progress across the course; and</li>
      <li>easily distribute completed reports to students as part of their course feedback.</li>
      </ol> 
	  
      <p>When you are assigned a report to complete, the process is as follows:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>You will receive an email containing a link to your My Assignments page.</li>
          <li>Your My Assignments page will contain a list of your assignments along with
			   links to take you directly to the correct report form for each student. </li>
          <li>You <strong>should not forward or share emails containing marking links</strong> - 
			  they contain security tokens providing access to your assignments .</li>
          <li>For extra security, we now also need you to <strong>enter a session token</strong>. 
			  When you first access an assignment page, you will be forwarded to a page to enter
			  a security token, which will be emailed to you.</li>
          <li>Once you've started a report, you can <strong>save</strong> your progress
			   in your report and come back to it.</li>
          <li>Once you have finished your report, you <strong>must click on the 
			  submit button</strong>.</li>
          <li>You will not be able to edit submitted reports but you <strong>will</strong> still
			   be able to see your completed report and download a PDF file of the confidential
			    report.</li>
          <li>Once the project marking and examining has been completed, a link to download 
			  a public version of the report will be sent to the student. This public report 
			  excludes private comments to course organisers and the grade you assigned.</li>
      </ul>

        <BR><H4>Dear Students</H4>
        <p>This online app provides you access to advertised projects - please have a look at the
			 drop down menu items above.</p>
        <p>Your supervisors and examiners will also use this app to prepare their marking reports
			 on your projects. You can see the forms and marking criteria at 
			 <a href={{=URL('criteria_and_forms')}}> this page</a></p>
			 
		<p>Once the project examination process is completed, you will be
			 emailed a link that will allow you to download their marking reports. These reports 
			 are a bit like a reviewer's comments on a scientific paper - they will give you 
			 information on what might be needed to improve your project and what skills you 
			 need to work on in the lab. They should be constructive and positive - they may 
			 sometimes also be a bit blunt at times, but that is common in the review process!</p>

      <BR><H4>Security of this system</H4>
      <p>In order to access a marking assignment, either to provide a report or to download 
		  a released report, a user needs a link that pairs an assignment record number with 
		  the correct UUID4 access token. </p>
      <ul>
          <li>These tokens have 122 random bits: there are a vast number of unique 
			  identifiers (2<sup>122</sup> &asymp; 5.3 x 10<sup>36</sup>).</li>
          <li>They are assigned randomly and automatically when assignments are generated 
			  and are stored securely in the marking database.</li>
          <li>There is a staff access security token that allows markers and examiners to 
			  access forms to complete. These pages are additionally secured using a session
			  token - these will be emailed to the marker when they access a marking page.
		  </li>
          <li>There is also a separate, different public access token that allows students 
			  to download PDFs of released reports.</li>
          <li>The chances of finding any correct pairing of record and UUID4 is <strong>vanishingly
			   small</strong> and finding one for a specific report is even less likely.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This system allow us to distribute marking and to give students access to reports 
		  without having to have user registration. We use session tokens to provide a second
		  factor for access but, <b style='color:red'>you should not forward the links to 
		  anyone else.</b></p>
