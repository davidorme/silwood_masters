<p>Dear {{=name}},</p>

<p>Many thanks in advance for marking and assessing projects for the Silwood Masters programs. We 
	use an online system to submit assessment reports and we strongly recommend that you quickly 
	review the following:</p>

{{=P(A('Assessment overview and guidance', _href=URL('marking_reports', 'overview', scheme=True, host=True)))}}

<p>In particular, please pay attention to the statements on:</p>

<ul><li>unconscious bias and</li>
	<li>open assessment.</li>
</ul>
	
<p>If you are a project marker, your assigned marking will also include marking a research 
	presentation and the project viva. Please do pay attention to the different assessment types, 
	described in the link above.</p>
	
<p> To view your marking, you will first need to submit your email address to
	{{=A('login to the marking system ', _href=login_url)}}. You will then get an
	email with secure links to your marking.
</p>

<p>The summary below shows the number of each kind of report that still need to be submitted:</p>
