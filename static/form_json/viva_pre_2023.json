In the absence of a strong argument why one mark is more appropriate, it is usual to apply the benefit of the doubt and take the higher of two adjacent grades on the scale (e.g. 55 and 58 goes to 58) and the midpoint of two grades within two grade points of each other (e.g. 68 and 76 goes to 72).</p><p>If the agreed grade does not follow this simple rule of thumb, you must edit the justification to explain your decision. For large disparities between the two grades or if markers cannot agree on a grade, a third opinion will be sought after the viva has been concluded. The grade dropdown includes a specific option to indicate that moderation is required.</p>",
